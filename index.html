    <h2 class="title">Good design is</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>
              <span class="number">1.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">innovative.</span></h3>
              <p>Technology changes rapidly, and with it, so does design. If we don’t strive to come up with new solutions, we’re bound to fail. Technological advancements and innovative design depend on each other.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">2.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">useful.</span></h3>
              <p>Everyone appreciates objects with a pleasing aesthetic as well as functionality. Good design stresses both of those aspects and ensures usability.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">3.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">aesthetic.</span></h3>
              <p>We’re all naturally attracted to beautiful things. Aesthetic quality of an object is likely to encourage usability.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">4.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">understandable.</span></h3>
              <p>The most important aspect of an object besides its aesthetic quality is the immediate understanding of its purpose. Something that is well-designed can stand independently, without explanation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">5.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">unobtrusive.</span></h3>
              <p>something that is meant to be simple in purpose should physically resemble that quality.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">6.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">honest.</span></h3>
              <p>Good design keeps essential function of an object as its focus; It doesn’t unnecessarily add to the object. It doesn’t look like more than it is.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">7.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">long-lasting.</span></h3>
              <p>Well-designed things are timeless. They don’t follow trends that come and go but keep their universal elements relevant despite the passing of time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">8.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">thorough down to the last detail.</span></h3>
              <p><span class="double">Every aspect of an object should be considered. No small detail should be avoided. To consider absolutely everything with care is to show consideration to the user.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">9.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">environmentally friendly.</span></h3>
              <p><span class="double">Well-designed things should be lasting. Good design minimizes use of resources and avoids unnecessary visual and physical pollutants.</span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <span class="number">10.</span>
              <h3><span class="rule">as little design as possible.</span></h3>
              <p><span class="double">Less is more; avoiding adding things onto an object when they don’t aid its function is key. Avoid over-designing, visually complicated design causes frustration. Keep It Simple, Stupid.</span></p>
